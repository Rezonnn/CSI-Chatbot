Start the Student Organization Registration Process ​​Start your student organization registration by selecting one Principal Member to initiate the online registration process for your student organization. The Principal Member who starts the student organization registration will also be listed as the President/Chair in the student organization registration portal. Register a New Organization Log into the registration portal using your student login information. In the homepage select the green box “Register or Re-Register an organization for 2025-2026” to begin the process. If you are a new organization, select “If your organization is not listed on the drop-down, register HERE as a new organization” below Organization Name Fill Out the “Create New Student Organization” form. Be sure to review all the information to make certain it is correct. Re-Register an Organization Log into the registration portal using your student login information. In the homepage select the green box “Register or Re-Register an organization for 2025-2026” to begin the process. Choose your student organization’s name from the drop-down in the re-registration portal. Only student organizations who ended the previous academic year in “Current” status will appear in the drop-down and will be able to choose the re-registration option. Fill Out the “Re-Register An Existing Student Organization” form. Be sure to review all the information to make certain it is correct and make any necessary updates. Step 2. Choose Your Organization’s Name and Purpose If registering a new student organization, create and choose a unique and clear name for your organization. You are required to review this document on Naming Your Student Organizations which outlines policies and guidelines pertaining to: Use of the University’s name in your student organization Use of duplicate student organization names The University’s branding guidelines for student organizations Each student organization is required to describe clearly and specifically the purpose of the organization. If the stated purpose is too vague or general, you will be contacted to provide more information. Step 3. Select an Organization Category and Type Student Organization Category Determine the purpose of your student organization and select a student organization category. Some student organization categories have additional registration requirements that could include: Specific affiliations, acquiring a Community Mentor, turning in rosters, waivers, and insurance forms, and other documents or special requirements Student Organization Type Your Principal Members determine your type of group. Your group is considered: An undergraduate organization and eligible for Associated Students funding if 100% of the principal members are undergraduates. Check out the AS Finance page for the AS Funding Guide A graduate organization and eligible for Graduate & Professional Student Association (GPSA) funding if 100% or more of the principal members are graduate students. A combined organization if at least 1 but fewer than 50% of the principal members are graduate students. Combined student organizations are eligible for Associated Students funding, but not eligible for GPSA funding. To change your Student Organization Category or Type, email your CSI Student Organization Advisor to complete the change for you. Step 4. Select Three Principal Members and Complete Individual Requirements Select a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 currently registered and enrolled UC San Diego students to be your fellow Principal Members. The Principal Member who starts the student organization registration will send the email invitations via the registration portal to the other Principal Members. Send the Principal Member invite to their UC San Diego email address. As part of the registration process, each Principal Member must: Complete the online CSI Registration Quiz on an annual basis (linked in the Registration Portal) Electronically sign the Principal Member agreement on an annual basis (linked in the Registration Portal) Take the online Hazing Education Training on an annual basis (linked in the Registration Portal) Attend the Tritons Together – ART of Inclusive Communication Workshop. If you previously completed the workshop, you do not need to take it again, even if the requirement was completed for a different student organization. Graduate student Principal Members are NOT required to take the workshop. Principal Members (PMs) should familiarize themselves with the 25-26 Principal Member Agreement. Principal Members continuing from the previous academic year must complete all of the steps above annually. Step 5. Principal Members Enroll in NCRC Principal Members must enroll in the Tritons Together – ART of Inclusive Communication Workshop, a three-hour workshop. Workshops will be offered both virtually and in-person. Please check the calendar carefully to note which workshops are held in person. The workshop is required for all undergraduate student Principal Members to complete. Graduate student Principal Members are NOT required to take the workshop. Only students who are currently registered UC San Diego students may be Principal Members. If signing up as a Principal Member before Fall classes begin, you must enroll in Fall quarter classes before the registration system will allow you to complete the student organization registration process and/or enroll in a Tritons Together-Art of Inclusive Communication workshop. If you previously completed the workshop, you do not need to take it again, even if the requirement was completed for a different student organization. Step 6. Upload Constitution Your organization must have an updated constitution on record. A constitution serves as a guiding document of operations for your organization. When you fill out the registration form you will be required to upload a constitution. Your constitution will be reviewed by CSI staff. Ensure your constitution includes all required sections and language which is outlined in the Constitutional Guidelines document. Otherwise, this will delay your approval process. Step 7. Find a Community Mentor A Community Mentor is a UC San Diego staff or faculty OR a member of the San Diego community that is familiar with the focus and purpose of your organization. Community Mentors should be able to attend general body meetings and events and provide support/resources. Community Mentors are not required for ALL student organizations but are highly encouraged. The following Student Organization Categories DO require a Community Mentor. Academic Department Affiliated Health Profession Interfraternity Council (IFC) Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) Panhellenic Association (PHC) Pre-Professional Community Mentors must review the Community Mentor Resources Training and complete the Community Mentor Signature Page. Please find the organization you advise in order to sign the Signature Page. If you do not find their name, they have not registered their organization for this academic year.

The sooner you register, the sooner your organization will be eligible to utilize all of the benefits of being a registered student organization at UC San Diego, including access to CSI advisor, reserving space, applying and receiving Associated Students funding, and more! Can our student organization take part in off-campus service events? Our organization is concerned about liability for our members and community organizations. Student organizations at UC San Diego are considered legally third party to the university. CSI is equipped to advise students about on-campus events only. For questions regarding legal or liability consequences of hosting off-campus events, please contact Student Legal Services at sls@ucsd.edu. We recommend reviewing CDC guidelines which are located here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html What is required to register a student organization? We've built a webpage detailing all necessary requirements. For questions around navigating the registration process, please contact our Student Organization Advisors during drop-in hours (beginning Week 1) or directly: https://getinvolved.ucsd.edu/about/staff.html#Student-Organizations-Advising We want to change the name of our organization. Would we re-register or register as a new org? If your organization was registered last year, re-register under the old name. Then send an email to your CSI Advisor requesting the name change. Remember you will need to update your constitution's title and throughout the document with the new name! Please be sure to familiarize yourself with UC San Diego’s branding/naming policies for student organizations. What if we want to change our student organization's category after we register and/or part way through the academic year? You will need to contact your CSI advisor and let them know that you would like to change categories. Please make sure to review the student organization category requirements before switching: https://getinvolved.ucsd.edu/one-stop/register/requirements.html Who should I contact if I have student organization registration questions? Please reach out to the advisor of the category your organization is in or will be, registered under. Click here for a list of the CSI advisors and the categories they advise: https://getinvolved.ucsd.edu/orgs/student-organization-advisors.html.

In order to continue to operate your student organization (reserve space, complete TAPs, utilize already allocated/approved funding, and apply for new funding) you will need to add enough PMs to meet the minimum requirement of 3. Once the minimum is met and all necessary requirements by the new PMs have been completed, your organization will be moved back to “Current” status and can continue to operate. How Can Principal Members Be Added? Select/elect/appoint new PMs A current PM of your organization will need to log into the student organization registration portal and send the new PMs a Principal Member Invitation via their UC San Diego email address Newly added PMs will receive their Principal Member Invitation in their email inbox and will need to: Accept the invitation by clicking on the link in the Principal Member Invitation email Electronically sign the Principal Member Agreement in the registration portal Complete the CSI Registration Quiz in the registration portal Sign-up and attend the ART of Inclusive Communication virtual workshop Workshop only needs to completed once Graduate students are not required to take the workshop CSI: Student Organizations Student Organization Drop-In Advising Contact the CSI Front Desk Monday-Friday, 8:30 am-4:30pm Physical Location: Price Center East, Level 3 (map) Phone: 858-534-1733 Email: csifrontdesk@ucsd.edu Instagram Org Toolkit Resources Register Your Student Org Manage Your Student Org Finances & Funding Event Planning: TAP Student Org Registration FAQs",

We share the outrage, anger, frustration, exhaustion, and deep sadness at the lives that continue to be taken from our Black communities and we stand in solidarity with all who are working to make our communities safe and just. The emotional toll and fear faced by many in our communities does not go unnoticed. We care about you. We hear you. We stand with you. We must all work together to fight for and support members of our Black community, disrupt systems that perpetuate racism, anti-blackness, and injustice, and create a more inclusive communities where we study, work and live. It will take every one of us, consistently doing our part. Many have been looking for resources to educate themselves, identify spaces to be in community, and find ways to take action. There are many ways to deepen our understanding about oppression and injustice. Education about social justice is a form of self-empowerment. We have included a few initial resources to empower you, in your own way, to learn, take action, support community building, and care for yourself and others during this time.

      "text": "HOME Org Toolkit Event Planning: TAP Planning Your Student Org Event with TAP What is TAP? TAP stands for Triton Activity Planner. The TAP is an online event planning system for on-campus student organization events. It provides a central location where facility reservations, funding, technical services, contracts, and other event logistics are entered, processed, and approved. TAP is only used for on-campus student organization sponsored events. Off-campus events are not connected to TAP or approved by CSI advisors. Review the resources below to plan and enter your student organization’s event using TAP. You can also click here to learn more about TAP requirements and deadlines. VIRTUAL EVENTS Only virtual events utilizing University Funding (AS Funding, SPACES funding, Parents Funds) need to be TAP'd. Virtual Events Using University Funding Must be TAP’d 21 days prior to the event. Once you begin TAP, please select “Virtual Event” under the “Event Category\". Who can submit a TAP for an event? Students listed as principal members of registered student organizations may submit a TAP: Review the TAP checklist below to make sure you know what orders/ reservations you may need to make before you use TAP. Then use the online Triton Activities Planner (TAP) to plan and enter your event. When do I need to TAP? All on-campus events (with the exception of simple meetings, simple dance rehearsals and information-only tables) require a TAP submission. Simple Meeting: defined as a closed meeting for student organization members with no food, funding, speakers, games, initiation, film, or other activities. What Steps Does My Student Organization Need to Take to Plan and Get Approval for an On-Campus Event or Meeting?

TAP deadlines A TAP must be started no less than 21 calendar days prior to an event. A confirmed venue must be added to TAP no less than 21 days prior to an event. The TAP system will not allow you to start a TAP less than 21 days prior to your event date. The 21 day deadline is a strict deadline and is needed in order for the appropriate approvals to be routed, services confirmed, orders to be placed, contracts signed, funds to be reconciled, etc. TAP checklist Use the checklist below to find out what orders/ reservations you may need to make BEFORE you use TAP. Make sure you record all reservation/ confirmation numbers you receive with your orders.

Make your check payable to UC Regents, and deliver it to the Student Life Business Operations Office. Payment can also be made electronically. Your SLBO Fund Manager will provide an e-market link after you’ve submitted your TAP. If you have any more questions, please contact your SLBO fund manager. Location of your event Find out how to reserve a facility. Record your confirmation/ reservation info to enter in TAP. Main spaces used include: Classroom Event Space: Classrooms and lecture halls can only be used for simple student meetings, defined as closed meetings with no food, funding, speakers, or activities, and do not require a TAP.

Standard AV equipment in lecture halls is free, but outdoor sound amplification needs prior approval per the UCSD Policies and Procedures Manual, PPM 510-1,IX. For more information, check out Tech, Sound, and Setup. Food and beverages (including alcohol) Food on Campus: A Temporary Food Permit is required for public events involving food; UC San Diego groups and student organizations can apply via TAP, ensuring adherence to safety guidelines for food preparation and storage Barbecues/Grills on Library Walk: Reserve grills through Price Center Reservations for $40 per day. For use in other campus areas, you can rent from a pre-approved vendor. Classroom Meetings: Food is prohibited in classrooms ( Center Hall, Peterson, H&SS, etc.). Alcohol on Campus: To serve alcoholic beverages at a student organization event, follow university guidelines and consult with your CSI Advisor. You must use a university-approved third-party licensed beverage server. Review the UC San Diego Sponsored Event Guidelines before planning. For more information, please visit Food and Beverage Service. Marketing, publicity, and posting Find resources and links for where and how to publicize your event. Ensure you review the campus-wide posting guidelines before proceeding. Carnival games, inflatables, etc. All student organizations are required to use the university payment processes on TAP when ordering carnival games, inflatables, amusements and dunk tanks. This provides additional liability protections to student organizations and the University. Use the Approved Other Vendor List. Entertainment/ performance agreements Performance Agreements are required for all performers (speakers, band, DJ, dance group, etc.), paid OR unpaid, who are NOT current UC students, staff, or faculty. Any speakers who are current UC students, staff, or faculty (this includes all UC campuses) are not required to have a performance agreement. Alumni are required to complete a Performance Agreement unless they are a current UC staff or faculty member. Use the Contract Information Worksheet (PDF) to gather information to be used and entered into TAP. Note: The Student Life Business Office cannot process payments to UC employees. Additionally, student organizations MUST go through the TAP system to process any and all performance agreements. Security and safety Some events require licensed security guards. Factors like facility type, audience size, cash handling, and alcohol serving, for example, must be considered. Student Life collaborates with UC San Diego Police and approved security companies to review events for security needs. To determine the number of guards required, please connect with a facility manager of your venue, as they typically determine security requirements. You can also reach out to the event production staff, or your student organization advisor for questions about your event logistics. For more information, see Security and Safety at Student Events. Insurance and liability waivers Event Insurance: The University of California has purchased insurance to cover Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) for most on-campus events. The university pays for the coverage, but RSOs must ensure their event is registered with the carrier. The event insurance module on TAP will guide you on whether registration is necessary. Event Waivers: Please review the UC Hazard Class Chart (PDF) to determine whether your event requires participant waivers. Event waivers are also required if participants are minors or non-affiliates. If required, student organizations may create and store electronic waivers online through the ewaivers.ucsd.edu website. Certificate of Liability: A current Certificate of Liability Insurance is required of all off-campus catering vendors, in addition to other vendors as specified by the University. For more information about insurance, waivers, and certificate of liability, visit Required Insurance and Liability Waivers. Showing films and videos In order for student organizations to show films and shows outside of an academic classroom setting, Public Performance Rights (PPR) are needed. You can learn more about this policy and how to obtain rights here. Public Performance Rights (PPR) are required whenever a film or show is shown outside of an academic setting in places accessible to the public or large gatherings beyond a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances (Title 17, U.S. Code). PPRs can be obtained by contacting the copyright holder and purchasing them, or obtaining written permission to screen the film. PPRs often come with costs, which can exceed $500. It is crucial that you plan ahead since it may take at least 2 weeks to acquire the rights for your selected film/show. Contact your student organization advisor for more information. Event sponsors Consider having two or more organizations or departments sponsor your program and share the cost and responsibilities. Recommended statement for events with event sponsors: The following statement is recommended to be verbally stated at an event and included on any advertisement (i.e. flyers, websites, or public communication) when an event is sponsored by on- or off-campus entities: \"The views expressed at these events do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors or of the University of California, San Diego. As a public institution of higher education, UCSD supports and protects the free expression of a variety of ideas and perspectives, which is vital to a learning community.\" Parking To obtain an estimate of costs for guest parking and transportation services, visit: Arrange Event Parking and Transportation for Guests. For an official quote, please email eventsparking@ucsd.edu or submit a Space Request Form. Since student organizations do not have a departmental index, please specify \"Check\" in the Space Request form when prompted for the index number. This is unless your organization received department/university funding to cover parking costs. Payments made via check must be delivered in person to the Transportation Services office at Campus Service Complex Building D. This should be done within 5 business days of receiving the reservation confirmation or at least 2 days before the event date, whichever comes first. For further inquiries, please reach out to Transportation Services directly at eventsparking@ucsd.edu. Triton Print & Digital Media Triton Print & Digital Media is an on-campus print and document service that can be used for: Flyers Programs Posters and Banners See Printing and Duplication Services. Fundraising events/ raffles for outside charities To fundraise for an outside charity, you must obtain an official letter from your chosen charity that includes their taxpayer ID number and specifics on how the funds raised align with your organization’s purpose. This letter must be displayed during your fundraising event. You must turn in a fundraising Income Report (PDF) to your advisor or to Student Life Business Operations within 14 days of your fundraising event. Student Organizations wishing to hold a raffle or opportunity drawing should carefully review State and University policies here. If you have questions, please contact Student Legal Services for free legal counsel. For more information, visit Fundraising Events for Outside Charities Ticket sales Check with facility/ venue contact to determine the venue capacity before starting your ticket sales. Depending on the event type, venue, and capacity, you may need to hire ticket takers. For more details, your CSI advisor can provide further assistance. Remember that A.S., GPSA and Triton Community Fund (TCF) will not fund events that charge admission fees. Please read the AS Funding Guide, GPSA Funding Guide or the TCF Funding Guide for more information. Vendors In order for vendor items to be paid for, you MUST provide: An invoice or official quote from the vendor. This MUST be uploaded to the vendor module in TAP more than 14 days prior to the event date. If using university funding, purchases must be made from an approved vendor. See Approved Vendors List. For any off-campus vendors that are not listed in the approved other vendors list (remove link for clarity), a Certificate of Liability Insurance (sample PDF) must be uploaded to TAP. If you're trying to use a vendor not listed in the approved other vendors list (remove link for clarity), please work with your student organization advisor more than 21 days prior to your event. Learn more about: Payment to Vendors Invoice examples for food and service orders. Questions? After you submit your TAP, your advisor may contact you to set up a meeting.

I was able to participate last year as well and seeing the students I work with in 6th grade now and their excitement to see me really solidified how much I want to work with children. I'm applying to graduate school and this experience has helped me make the decision to try and specialize in school age social work. The teachers at the school were great and working with Mrs. Joy has been a top tier experience.” “Being able to volunteer at Belmont [Senior Apartment Complex through San Diego Housing Commission] has been a great experience so far where I have truly felt like I have learned a lot about myself and even what I could see myself doing in the future career wise. It has been a transformative experience for me reflective wise and I would hope to continue volunteering here.” “Volunteering at Kupanda this quarter was an amazing experience which I'm looking forward to again in the Winter. From the children to the people who work there, I have met many great and fun personalities who made the experience particularly welcoming. Craig and Jaffari let me know my presence was much appreciated and I really felt at home. I was always eager to see the children and I believe they too were excited to see.” “This experience has solidified my commitment to public service and working in spaces where I can directly support marginalized communities. Long term, I want to advocate for educational equity and policy change. In the short term, I am more focused on developing mentorship skills and being present for youth who need a support figure in their lives.” FAQs FAQs: Do I need previous volunteering experience? No experience is required! Any necessary training is provided by community partners and the Center for Student Involvement at UC San Diego. Is transportation provided? Yes!

Each quarter, EDI Peers develop and conduct interactive EDI workshops that are presented to each chapter. Workshops focus on a variety of social justice issues and create a space to increase students’ understanding of EDI topics as they relate to SFL, UC San Diego, and the broader community. Our Mission The Sorority & Fraternity Life Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Peer Ambassadors are a catalyst for critical thinking, constructive dialogue, and personal development surrounding topics of social justice, campus climate, and cultural competence. Through active practices that celebrate and promote access and representation of diverse experiences, cultures, and identities, every member is challenged to collaborate in fostering a more inclusive community. Cornerstone Outcomes Dialogue Allyship Bystander Intervention Intersectionality Action Steps History The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Peer Ambassador Program was established in Fall 2015 to address the growing need of social justice education and dialogue within Sorority and Fraternity Life. The program began with nine students, three from each of the fraternal councils, who shared a common purpose to create a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive community at UC San Diego. The nine Peer Ambassadors developed a platform to discuss EDI issues that were impacting our students on a daily basis. In Spring 2016, they expanded their role and began facilitating dialogues within each of the sorority and fraternity chapters. Since then, the EDI Peer Educator program continues to expand and address the issues facing our sorority and fraternity community. They are embedded in all aspects of the SFL experience, beyond chapter presentations as they facilitate sessions at new member educational programming, community-wide leadership retreats, Panhellenic recruitment counselor training, community-wide recruitment workshops, and council specific programming.

Our community comes together with other campus collaborators on this day to provide resources to members, knowing that this is a prevalent issue on college campuses. Health and Wellness Fair In the Fall, we host a Health & Wellness Fair in collaboration with other departments to provide resources to students to encourage safe practices and awareness of campus resources, including healthy sleeping habits to stress management and alcohol awareness. Risk Management Panel In the Winter, we bring together campus partners with expertise in risk management, such as the University Police Department, Student Legal Services, Student Accountability, Growth, and Education, and the Office of the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination, to serve on a panel where they provide members with important information and answer their questions to practice safety within their chapters. SFL Summerfest This annual event brings together our community to welcome all incoming and returning students with free games, food, and entertainment. This is a great opportunity for students to learn more about our organizations in a fun and fair-like atmosphere. Sorority & Fraternity Leaders Conference This fall leadership conference is led by the three council presidents and aims at providing leadership development to the general community members. Campus partners are invited for breakout sessions and along with a keynote speaker. In the past three years the keynote speakers have covered sexual assault, consent, and diversity. SFL Retreat Annual winter quarter retreat for council leaders, presidents, and officers that focuses on community building, leadership development, and diversity education. This program is traditionally spearheaded by the graduate assistant and takes a different format every year. SFL Awards Serves as a community wide program planned by leaders of the councils to recognize the sororities and fraternities for their accomplishments as values-based organizations. Sororities and fraternities as groups and individual members are recognized for their outstanding work in Academic Excellence, Leadership Development, Community Service, Philanthropic Efforts, and Commitment to Community. SFL Week This week is an event series through a collaboration between the four councils that focuses on bringing all chapters together in community to support a shared cause, promote unity, and cross-council relations. Benefits of Membership Leadership Opportunities There are many benefits to membership in SFL organizations, including access to various leadership development opportunities, including the following: Association of Fraternal Leadership & Values (AFLV) https://aflv.org/ Undergraduate Interfraternity Institute (UIFI) https://aflv.org/uifi Council Executive Boards Chapter Executive Boards Job Opportunities There are several job opportunities specifically for affiliated sorority or fraternity members including the following. Applications for these jobs are posted periodically on Handshake. SFL Office Student Jobs EDI Peers CARE at SARC Liaisons Scholarship Opportunities Although membership dues are a requirement for most chapters, there are scholarships available to offset these costs. Inquire directly with these sources to learn more. Council Scholarships National Organization Scholarships Local Alumni & Alumnae Boards Philanthropic Efforts Philanthropy, or the raising of funds for a charitable cause, is a core value of many of our chapters. This past year, chapters and their members raised over $190,000 dollars for various local and international organizations. Many members join SFL chapters because they have seen or been recipients of the impact of these monies raised and wish to give back to these same organizations. Academic Success Support At an already academically rigorous institution, SFL students are high achieving and are set up with a stronger baseline of success in their chapters with study groups, study plans, and friends to take classes with which further supports their academic achievement. It has also been proven in many studies that students involved in sororities or fraternities have higher GPAs than those who are not; in Spring 2025 the All SFL GPA Spring 2025 was 3.337 compared to the All Undergraduate GPA at a 3.271.” Sorority & Fraternity Join SFL!

The SFL Strategic Plan Steering Committee includes student leaders from MGC, CPA, IFC, NPHC, and EDI Peer Ambassadors, SFL Advisors & Program Managers, the Associate Director of SFL, the Executive Director of the Center for Student Involvement, and the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life. The committee combined suggestions included in the 2020 SFL External Review Report with additional feedback and ideas from hundreds of stakeholders to identify the key priorities found in this plan. Many thanks to all who contributed their energy, time, and ideas to this effort. This Plan is a living document and will be reviewed and updated annually. The objectives have been distributed across the 5 year timeframe to allow for thoughtful, focused attention on each initiative. However, the SFL team will continue advancing key priorities on an ongoing basis. Additionally, we expect the objectives to morph as annual revisions are made and new needs are identified. We look forward to sharing annual reports as the plan continues to evolve. The 5 year strategic plan serves as a roadmap for advancing a community oriented and leadership focused member experience.

      "text": "HOME Sorority & Fraternity Parents & Family Information for Parents and Families Dear Triton Parents and Families, Congratulations on your student's admission and decision to attend UC San Diego! There are endless ways to get involved on campus and to be a leader, serve the community, and make new friends. When exploring what UC San Diego has to offer, we hope that your student will consider the opportunity to join Sorority & Fraternity Life (SFL) and join a community of like-minded individuals and build a true connection on campus. Sorority and fraternity organizations at UC San Diego stand for character development, lifelong friendships, equity, diversity, & inclusion, academic excellence, and community responsibility. For many parents, the idea of sororities and fraternities conjure up concern with images from popular movies and television shows; but the media is simply not reality. There are many myths about the SFL community, but the truth is that members in fraternities and sororities are committed to high moral principles and social standards. Multiple studies show that students involved in SFL organizations gain valuable business skills, are more likely to graduate on time, have better interpersonal skills, and are more likely to give back to the community. In fact, as of the 24-25 academic year, SFL students at UC San Diego raised over $196,710.13 for charitable causes and served over 17,000 service hours. Sorority and fraternity students are also known to have a higher GPA than general student on campus; in Spring 2025 the All SFL GPA Spring 2025 was 3.337 compared to the All Undergraduate GPA at a 3.271. You will also find SFL students in all realms of campus involvement including honor societies, orientation leaders, student government, and athletics. Updated sorority and fraternity accomplishments and data can be found on the SFL Community Performance Reports. We encourage you to explore this website for resources and documents that may help answer questions or alleviate concerns. We look forward to working with your student this year! Best, Sorority & Fraternity Life How will my student benefit from involvement in SFL at UC San Diego? Attending college is a huge life change! Joining the sorority and fraternity community will help make the transition to life at UC San Diego a smooth one. Belonging to a SFL organization can help make an institution of over 30,000 undergraduate students feel smaller and more comfortable. For most members, their organization becomes their family away from home. It will be up to your student to determine the level of involvement they want to have in the organization. There are many benefits to membership in a sorority or fraternity. In addition to life-long friendships, members have access to endless leadership possibilities, academic support, philanthropic and volunteer opportunities, and professional networking! How will joining benefit my student after college? The friendships your student will make through their organization are intended to last far beyond college. Sororities and fraternities have alumni networks all over to assist members in making connections and advancing careers. Wherever your student ends up after graduation, chances are they will be able to connect with fellow members of the same organization or other sororities and fraternities through alumni organizations. As a result of joining a sorority or fraternity, students can participate in leadership leadership roles that allow them to enhance their skills in organization, networking, time management and much more. These roles look great on resumes and can help students in preparation for their careers after college. Will involvement in a SFL organization affect my student’s academic performance? As a whole, the SFL community has either matched or exceeded the all-campus GPA average. In fact, high academic standards are a criterion for membership. Chapters also organize tutoring programs, develop individualized academic support programs, host study hours, and offer resources and programs focused on academic excellence. Most organizations even offer scholarships and awards to recognize high achieving members. See our Community Grade Reports. What about hazing? All new sorority and fraternity members participate in an orientation period for new members. During this new member period, your student and fellow new members will participate in regular meetings and events to learn about the University, fraternity/sorority history, leadership retreats, community service projects, and activities designed to build friendships among new members and initiated members. The SFL Staff, in collaboration with University partners, hosts a variety of required trainings throughout the academic year specific to new members, chapter leaders, and general members that defines hazing behavior, the consequences, and promotes dialogue on ways to best promote sense of belonging, safety, and a positive new member experience. Additionally, all members are offered annual hazing prevention training and sent quarterly emails with expectations around hazing prevention and resources on how to report hazing. All UC San Diego organizations have a strict policy against hazing. UC San Diego takes a strong stand against hazing as outlined in the University's Standards of Conduct as well as California state law. Learn more about hazing. Who supports SFL organizations on campus? Sororities and fraternity organizations are very unique! While they are student run, there is also an element of alumni and institutional support. Additionally, all sororities and fraternities are members of governing councils that support individual councils and practice self governance and accountability. Lastly, all sorority and fraternity organizations have support and guidance from a local, regional, or national governing board. On a regular basis students are elected to officer positions. Officers manage the day-to-day operations of their chapter. Chapter Officers are exposed to a variety of training opportunities to provide them with the tools to lead their organization’s operations. Officers develop skills in leadership, communication, accountability, event planning, and many others. The group is governed by a(n) inter/national headquarters, which establishes regulations and offers direction through professional staff and volunteers. Alumni members in the community act as advisors to ensure compliance with inter/national policies. The Sorority & Fraternity Life area within the Center for Student Involvement serves as the staff liaison to the sorority and fraternity community, offering support, advice and guidance to governing councils, chapter officers, advisors, and members. Additionally, SFL hosts quarterly educational, leadership, and connection opportunities for all leaders and members. Connect with the SFL Team. How much will it cost? As third party organizations to the University, membership dues are managed entirely by the sorority and fraternity chapter and their inter/national headquarters. There is no set cost for membership and fees vary between chapters and councils, some organizations charge no membership fee. New members can expect to pay higher dues their first quarter of membership than in subsequent ones. However these fees cover many perks from service and social events, to chapter meals, to leadership conferences. Be sure your student inquires as to the full cost of membership before joining. Don’t forget most organizations offer payment plans and scholarships! What is my role as parent / family? Ask questions and be involved! Encourage your student to keep an open mind about each organization they connect with as fraternities and sororities are different on every campus and are deeper than their perceived image. Be in support, but let your student guide their own decision making in joining the organization they feel most aligned with. Sorority and fraternity recruitment is based on a mutual selection process, and students may not always become members of their ‘first-choice’ organization. That said, students can find academic, social, service, and leadership opportunities in each sorority or fraternity chapter offered on campus. Be in communication with your student through the recruitment process and motivate them to ask important questions regarding time commitments, financial commitments, and membership expectations. Once your student chooses to join a SFL organization, there will be opportunities for attending chapter events, and getting to know your students new friends. Take the time to talk to your student about being a member of the SFL community. Additionally, the SFL advising team is a resource for parents if any concerns or questions arise. How can I encourage my student to get involved? Students interested in joining a fraternity or sorority are encouraged to explore this website, attend informational sessions hosted at the beginning of Fall, Winter, or Spring quarters, visit with individual members, or talk to the SFL Advising Team located on the third floor of Price Center. There are around 40+ different sororities and fraternity organizations on campus — so there is something for everyone! Sorority & Fraternity Join SFL!

A list of conduct cases resolved in the last five years and their disciplinary status can be found on their website. This information is provided to further educate students and parents to make informed decisions when pursuing ways to get involved on campus. Current Student Organization Case Status Summaries Sorority & Fraternity Life provides new member education, leadership training, hazing awareness and prevention seminars, alcohol and drug health awareness and risk mitigation education to support students joining the SFL community. One concerning trend is the development of unrecognized Greek-lettered organizations that seek out members of our student community without the educational and accountability activities provided by the institution. Joining an unrecognized sorority or fraternity may pose an increased risk as they are not upheld to the same organizational accountability standards. Students, SFL members, and registered student organizations are encouraged to not engage with de-registered and unrecognized organizations. Those with concerns about any organization’s activities, recognized or unrecognized, should contact the Sorority & Fraternity Life Office. Sorority & Fraternity Join SFL!

      "text": "HOME Org Toolkit Manage Your Student Org High Pressure Groups High Pressure Groups Some UC San Diego student organizations and events are affiliated with outside groups. While the vast majority of groups may be helpful and beneficial to you, some may use high-pressure tactics to recruit students. The information below can help you make an informed, free choice about associating with such groups. Why are high-pressure groups so harmful? They tend to isolate you from family, friends, and other groups. They may ask you to give up control of your thoughts or decisions. They may focus on guilt and shame. They may promote crises with school, your career, or your social life. What are warning signs of a high-pressure group? Ask yourself these questions: Does the group or its representatives: Speak in a derogatory way about your past religious affiliation? Describe your parents as unable to understand or help you with religious matters? Label your doubts and questions as signs of a weak faith? Invite you on a retreat but can't (or won't) give you an overview of the purpose or activities before you go? Insist that you spend so much time with them that you can't get your studying done or you don't have time for your other friends and activities? Pressure you to get others involved in the group? Discourage you from keeping in touch with your family and friends or not allow you to talk to your friends or your family alone? Deflect questions you ask about their group and tell you they'll answer your questions later? Claim to have the answers to your problems and that you can't find answers anywhere else? Pressure you to give them money? Answering \"yes\" to one or two questions doesn't mean that a group is destructive or harmful, but it does mean you should proceed slowly and investigate the group more carefully. Questions?

The following are some examples of hazing divided into three categories: subtle, harassment, and violent. It is impossible to list all possible hazing behaviors because many are context-specific. While this is not an all-inclusive list, it provides some common examples of hazing traditions. Subtle Hazing Behaviors that emphasize a power imbalance between new members / rookies and other members of the group or team are termed “subtle hazing” because these types of hazing are often taken for granted or accepted as “harmless” or meaningless. Subtle hazing typically involves activities or attitudes that breach reasonable standards of mutual respect and place new members / rookies on the receiving end of ridicule, embarrassment, and/or humiliation tactics. New members / rookies often feel the need to endure subtle hazing to feel like part of the group or team. (Some types of subtle hazing may also be considered harassment hazing). Some examples: Deception Assigning demerits Silence periods with implied threats for violation Deprivation of privileges granted to other members Tasks of personal servitude Memorization of information not explicitly required by the national new member process Requiring new members / rookies to perform duties not assigned to other members Socially isolating new members / rookies Line-ups and drills / tests on meaningless information Name calling Requiring new members / rookies to refer to other members with titles (e.g. “Mr.,” “Miss”) while they are identified with demeaning terms Expecting certain items to always be in one's possession Harassment Hazing Behaviors that cause emotional anguish or physical discomfort in order to feel like part of the group. Harassment hazing confuses, frustrates, and causes undue stress for new members / rookies. (Some types of harassment hazing can also be considered violent hazing.) Some examples: Verbal abuse Threats or implied threats Asking new members to wear embarrassing or humiliating attire Wearing publicly, apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste, or requiring shaved hair Stunt or skit nights with degrading, crude, or humiliating acts Participating in personally degrading or humiliating games or activities Expecting new members / rookies to perform personal service to other members such as errands, cooking, cleaning etc Creation of extensive fatigue or forced or coerced participation in calisthenics, push-ups, sit-ups, running, and other fatiguing activities Tuck-ins Required (explicit or implicit) participation in quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips, or any such activities Engaging in public stunts or buffoonery Requiring the carrying of objects, such as bricks, buckets, or large objects Sleep deprivation Late work sessions or activities that interfere with scholastic activities, including exhausting and time consuming projects that are too disruptive to normal study patterns Sexual simulations Intentionally creating clean-up work Expecting new members / rookies to be deprived of maintaining a normal schedule of bodily cleanliness Be expected to harass others Any activity considered morally offensive by an individual participating Any activity without constructive aspect or reasonable purpose, including but not limited to \"line-ups,\" \"rat courts,\" mock trials, interrogations, yelling of obscenities, or votes of continuance not consistent with the national constitution of, or sanctioned by the national fraternity or sorority Violent Hazing Behaviors that have the potential to cause physical and/or emotional, or psychological harm. Some examples: Forced or coerced alcohol or other drug consumption Forced, required, or coerced consumption of any food, liquid or other substance Physical abuse including paddling, beating, tattooing, pushing, hitting, physical threats, exposure to the elements, or other physical harm, or forms of assault Branding Forced or coerced ingestion of vile substances or concoctions Burning Water intoxication Expecting abuse or mistreatment of animals Public nudity Expecting illegal activity Bondage Confining participants to rooms or areas that are uncomfortable due to temperature, noise, size, or air quality for the purpose of harassment Any dangerous activity including, but not limited to long swims, jumps from high places, binding, and blindfolding Member ditches, abductions / kidnaps Exposure to cold weather or extreme heat without appropriate protection Any other activity which is not consistent with the fraternal law, ritual, or policy and/ or University Policies Laws and Campus Policies on Hazing California Law Matt's Law, (Senate Bill 1454) sponsored by Tom Torlakson (D-Antioch, CA), is a California law that allows for felony prosecutions when serious injuries or deaths result from hazing rites. The bill increases the severity of charges for some hazing rituals, from misdemeanors to felonies, and for the first time gives prosecutors the ability to seek hazing charges against non students. In a 34-2 vote, Matt’s Law passed the state Senate on May 30th, 2006. On September 19, 2006, the statute was signed into law by governor Arnold Schwarznegger. Matt's Law was named in memory of Matt Carrington, a 21-year-old California State University, Chico student from Concord, California. Carrington died in the basement of a fraternity house located two short blocks from campus. Prior to the enactment of Matt's Law, hazing — even in the case of death — was only a misdemeanor, as part of California's education code, rather than punishable under the state's penal code. Matt's law prevents unaffiliated fraternities from using the argument that they cannot be punished for hazing, simply because they are not student organizations. The law also gives prosecutors clear authority to bring charges against anyone or any organization involved in hazing, not just currently enrolled students. BILL TEXTPASSED THE SENATE - AUGUST 30, 2006PASSED THE ASSEMBLY - AUGUST 24, 2006INTRODUCED BY Senator TorlaksonFebruary 23, 2006THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:SEC. 3. Section 245.6 is added to the Penal Code, to read: (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as \"Matt's Law\" in memory of Matthew William Carrington, who died on February 2, 2005 as a result of hazing. (b) As used in this section \"hazing\" or \"haze\" is conduct which causes, or is likely to cause, bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to another person in the course of the other person's preinitiation into, initiation into, affiliation with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in any organization. The terms \"hazing\" or \"haze\" do not include customary athletic, fire department, police department, military, or quasi-military training, conditioning, or similar events or activities.(c) Any person who hazes or conspires to participate in hazing is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by both fine and imprisonment.(d) Any person who hazes or conspires to participate in hazing which results in death, great bodily injury, or great psychological injury is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.(e) An organization is guilty of violating subdivisions (b) or (c) if the organization's agents, directors, trustees, managers, or officers authorized, requested, commanded, encouraged, participated in, ratified, or tolerated the hazing.(f) The implied or expressed consent of the person or persons against whom the hazing was directed shall not be a defense to any action brought under this section.(g) This section does not apply to the person against whom the hazing was directed.(h) This section shall not, in any manner, limit or exclude prosecution or punishment for any other crime or any civil remedy.(i) The person against whom the hazing is directed may commence a civil action for injury or damages, including mental and physical pain and suffering that results from the hazing. The action may be brought against any participants in the hazing, or any organization whose agents, directors, trustees, managers, or officers authorized, requested, commanded, encouraged, participated in, ratified, or tolerated the hazing. If the organization is a corporation, whether for profit or not, the individual directors of the corporation maybe held individually liable for damages. SEC. 4. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.rev. 4/2007 SA-KW University Policies Student Conduct Code Student Organization Case Status Summaries In addition to managing the student conduct process for individuals, the Office of Student Conduct works with several campus partners, including the Center for Student Involvement, on cases regarding non-academic misconduct by Student Organizations. It is the belief of the Office of Student Conduct and these partners that students should be able to make informed choices when pursuing ways to get involved on campus. Therefore we have provided information below on Student Organizations' most recent conduct case summaries to assist students in making these decisions. Here you will find some brief information on the disciplinary status of some of our student organizations: Student Organization Case Status Summaries Sanctions for Hazing Hazing is a violation of both the UCSD Conduct Code and California law, whether the alleged activities occurred on campus or off campus. Student organizations and/or individual students accepting responsibility or found responsible for hazing may be suspended or dismissed from the University in addition to facing potential criminal sanctions, such as prison incarceration and monetary fines. Student organizations, sports clubs, and athletic teams involved in alleged hazing activities may lose their status as campus organizations. The UC San Diego policy on hazing can be found in the Student Conduct Code. The policy reads as follows: Section VII (K). Participation in hazing or any method of initiation or pre-initiation of potential, new, or active members into a Student Organization or other activity engaged in by the Student Organization or members of the Student Organization at any time that causes, or is likely to cause, physical injury or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in psychological harm to any Student or other person. Responding to Charges of Hazing Organizations charged with hazing may argue that an activity wasn't hazing because new members agreed to participate (perhaps due to peer pressure and a desire to fit in). But even if new members agreed to participate, the activity can still be considered hazing. Another common defense is that rogue members committed the hazing activity, unsanctioned by the organization. However, organizations have lost their campus status for hazing activities performed by members outside the leadership circle. Organization leaders are ultimately responsible for communicating ground rules for new member activities and for monitoring Learn More About Hazing Who commits hazing on California campuses? Hazing is commonly portrayed in movies as an activity of Greek fraternities and sororities. Hazing also occurs in intercollegiate athletics, sports clubs, religious clubs, marching bands, professional clubs, multicultural organizations, and other types of groups. Why does hazing persist on college campuses? Organizations are sometimes unaware that their initiation activities are actually hazing. Initiates may be hesitant to question such activities, which are often handed down by older members. The group may offset concerns about possible harm with the belief that they are fostering loyalty and bonding. No matter what group members believe, no one should ever be subjected to hazing. How can an organization determine if its activities count as hazing? To determine if activities are possibly harmful, organizations should consider how acceptable they would be from the perspective of the broader community. The \"publicity test\" asks the following questions: Would you let the campus newspaper or a local TV station cover your initiation activities? Would you be comfortable describing your activities to your parents, a professor, psychologist, or university chancellor? If the answer to these questions is \"No,\" your activities are most likely hazing. When in doubt, check with your organization's advisor or coach. Tips for new members If you are a new member of an organization, stay connected with friends outside of the group. If you suspect an activity may be hazing, talk to friends and family members about what you are experiencing and seek their advice. Refuse to participate in an activity if you suspect it's hazing, or quit the organization. Report any suspected hazing to campus officials, confidentially if you prefer. How to report suspected hazing incidents Any member of the campus, whether affiliated with the offending organization or not, has a responsibility to report hazing. The university takes allegations of hazing seriously and will investigate. UCSD extends its jurisdiction beyond the campus to any location where hazing has occurred. To report an incident, notify the UC San Diego Police Department or your college dean or resident dean. Additionally, below are further on-campus contacts for specific groups. Student organizations: Contact the Center for Student Involvement at hazing@ucsd.edu or call (858) 534-0501. Sports or recreation clubs: Call the sports/ recreation club advisor, (858) 534-8085. Intercollegiate athletics: Contact the coach of the sport, or call (858) 534-4211. When reporting an incident: Indicate who was involved, what happened, and when and where it occurred. Supply as much detail as possible. Provide your name, phone number, and e-mail address. Provide the contact information of any witnesses. You may file an anonymous report, but you should know that such a report can make an investigation more difficult and sometimes unsuccessful.

Community Mentor Responsibilities The specific roles and responsibilities of a mentor vary depending on the organization and the mentor, but most student organization advisors have the following responsibilities: Leadership development Through personal interaction and program development, you can play a significant role in developing members' leadership skills and personal growth and in identifying new leaders for the organization. Specific skills you could enhance include: Interpersonal communication Planning Organization Conflict Resolution Assisting with retreats and workshops Consultation You can serve as a consultant by: Meeting regularly with officers and chairpersons to keep current on projects and events they're planning. Serving as a resource person and, through continued open interaction, pointing out new perspectives and guiding the group toward activities and individual performance. Continuity Officers and members change frequently, and at times the only link with the past is the advisor. To enhance continuity, you can: Orient new officers and members to the history and purpose of the group and help them build upon it. Help members look toward the future by developing long-term goals and communicating them to new members. Be wary if the organization focuses on \"this is the way things have always been.\" Encourage creative brainstorming to help an organization generate new ideas. Personal assistance Your interaction with members gives you a unique opportunity to assist individuals with problems: Help students maintain a balance between academic and co-curricular aspects of student life. Make appropriate referrals by using your knowledge of campus and community resources. Interpretations of policy As a representative of the University to the organization, you are constantly in a position to interpret University policies and regulations as well as state and federal laws relevant to student organizations. One example is the Clery Act and Crime Reporting, a federal law that requires institutions of higher education to report crimes, provide notice of security policies, and give finely warnings.You should also be familiar with all organization policies, such as constitution, bylaws, and protocols. Supervision You have a responsibility to both the University and the organization to keep the best interests of both in mind. In a well run organization, the supervisory role may be minimal or nonexistent, and the advisor may need to intervene only to prevent the violation of public or institutional policy. Financial supervision Each organization should have a treasurer/finance director. Work with this individual to assure accurate record keeping and budgeting. Meeting organization Attend all regular and special meetings of the organization to keep informed and be available for consultation or to introduce ideas and suggestions. Many mentors have a time slot on meeting agendas when they can let the group know about upcoming campus events, congratulate members, offer remarks or evaluation, etc. Traits of a Community Mentor Teacher and educator Mentors use expertise, knowledge, and human relations skills to help teach students effectively. Mentors teach in an informal classroom setting where attendance is voluntary. Resource person Mentors gain a great deal of experience over time, which becomes extremely valuable to an organization. Some of the dimensions of a resource person include: Knowledge of University policies and services The ability to find pertinent information A historical perspective Coordinator and motivator This role is close to that of a resource person and teacher but is more action oriented. The mentor: Acts as a motivator and overseer for the organization Provides direction and communication that keep the group moving toward its goal Partner and friend This mentor trait is perhaps the easiest trait to fulfill. The mentor can: Provide students with an opportunity to vent their frustrations Become a friend and mentor to student volunteers Counselor This role is designed to handle the most basic counseling needs.

Your student organization may choose to have up to 8 Principal Members. Your Principal Members determine your type of group. Your group is considered: An undergraduate organization and eligible for Associated Students funding if 100% of the principal members are undergraduates. Check out the AS Finance page for the AS Funding Guide A graduate organization and eligible for Graduate & Professional Student Association (GPSA) funding if 50% or more of the principal members are graduate students. A combined organization if at least 1 but fewer than 50% of the principal members are graduate students. Combined student organizations are eligible for Associated Students funding, but not eligible for GPSA funding. Organizations must update their registration information when a Principal Member changes, or when the address or phone number of any Principal Member changes. This can be done by logging into the student organization registration portal. Only registered Principal Members may conduct official business with the University, including submitting events through TAP, reserving facilities, accessing budget numbers, and spending student organization funds. Principal Members assume full responsibility for obtaining applicable event liability waivers from event participants. Principal Members assume full responsibility for the student organization's financial status, actions, and programs. Each Principal Member accepts individual and joint responsibility for the administration and use of any and all funds, in compliance with all applicable UC San Diego policies. This includes any and all funding requests submitted by any Principal Member on behalf of the registered student organization. Principal Members must understand that student organizations may not be used as a conduit for personal financial gain or for the establishment of personal business. A Principal Member Agreement pertaining to compliance with UC and UC San Diego policies that apply to campus activities, organizations and students must be reviewed and signed by each Principal Member.

      "text": "HOME Org Toolkit Event Planning: TAP Safety, Security & Insurance Safety, Security, and Insurance at Student Events As you plan your event, be aware that you are required to make the appropriate insurance and security arrangements and use the appropriate waivers to plan a safe and secure event. Safety and Security The university strives to maintain a safe environment for all of its students, staff, faculty, affiliates, and guests. Student organization events submitted on TAP are reviewed for security on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the Major Events Protocol.The evaluation of a proposed security plan will focus solely on its effectiveness and appropriateness, without considering the viewpoints of external sponsors, speakers, or performers. Many factors should be considered in determining your event's security needs, including: Type of facility Overnight events Size of expected audience Past history of event or sponsor Cash handling/ box office services involved Serving of alcohol Potential to draw disruptive opposition to the event Sponsor's request for specific admission parameters (such as members only, ID required, dress code enforced, etc.) Depending on these factors, facility managers may require security personnel to be present for your event. The UC San Diego Police Department and approved security companies that are familiar with the UC San Diego campus can be hired if needed for your event. The facility manager and your student organizations advisor will work with you to determine security needs. Insurance & Liability Waivers General safety and risk management Registered student organizations can use the University's Special Events Safety Checklist Tool (PDF) as a guide when thinking about safety and risk management. RSOs are not required to complete the checklist tool. If you have any questions, please contact the facility manager at the location of your event. On-campus event insurance coverage The University of California has purchased an insurance program to cover Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) for most on-campus events. The university pays for the insurance costs for covered events by Mercer CampusConnexions, but RSOs are still responsible for making sure their on-campus event is registered with the insurance carrier. To determine if you need liability insurance for your on-campus event: Assess what level of risk your event/activity is by using the Risk/Hazard Class Chart. “Low risk” events and many “medium risk” events are covered. Events deemed as “high risk” events are not automatically covered and will need to apply with the insurance carrier. If your event is listed as having automatic coverage, no further action is needed. If your event is not covered automatically: Complete the quick 2-minute online application process. Print your Certificate of Insurance (for immediate proof of coverage) and upload it to the Event Insurance module on TAP. The University will pay for your coverage (if approved). If your event still does not qualify for coverage, contact Campus Connexions at 1-866-839-9536. This information can also be found in the event insurance module on TAP or the On-Campus Events tab at the RSO Event Liability website. Previously, student organization events and activities held on campus were not covered by the University of California's own insurance programs. This posed a problem for both students and the university because: The students had to rely on personal or family financial resources to defend a claim or lawsuit arising out of their activities. The university had no financial recourse when its property was damaged by student activities or when it received a claim or lawsuit arising from student activities. Event participation waivers Do you need waivers? Event participants must sign a waiver if: Participants are under the age of 18 (for any on-campus event). Participants that are not UC San Diego students, staff, or faculty Your event type is one that requires waivers. Please review the UC Hazard Class Chart (PDF) to determine whether your event requires participant waivers. Student organizations may create and store electronic waivers online through the ewaivers.ucsd.edu website or when completing the Event Participant Waiver module on TAP for their event. Get signatures Ensure that all event participants sign the waiver using one of the following options: Publicize the QR code or unique website generated by ewaivers.ucsd.edu on your event publicity or invitations. Provide paper versions using the PDF available at ewaivers.ucsd.edu. If you do not utilize the online e-waiver tool, the organization’s president(s) must keep all waivers for at least three (3) years to meet the statute of limitations. Day of event On the day of the event, check that all participants have signed a waiver. Visit ewaivers.ucsd.edu to view a list of participants who have signed the waiver electronically. You may choose to have paper copies or an electronic device available for event participants to complete the waiver before entering the event. Vendor insurance If your organization is working in collaboration with an off-campus vendor, a current Certificate of Liability Insurance naming the Regents of the University of California as 'Additional Insured' for no less than $1,000,000 coverage is required. In addition, if a vehicle will be used by the vendor in order to transport or provide a service on University property, automobile liability insurance must also be included in the coverage. The Certificate Holder must be named as: The Regents of the University of California University of California, San Diego9500 Gilman DriveLa Jolla, California 92093 The Certificate of Liability Insurance must be turned in to your CSI advisor or event facility manager at least 14 days prior to the event date. See a sample Certificate of Liability form (PDF). Off-campus event insurance coverage The University of California does not purchase liability insurance for off-campus activities hosted by student organizations but strongly recommends RSOs purchase liability insurance for these events. Without this insurance, your personal or family financial resources could be affected by a claim or lawsuit. This has occurred at other UC campuses. Visit the RSO Event Liability website and click on the Off-Campus Events tab for more information. Events with Minors If your student organization is looking to work with individuals under the age of 18, please contact your student organizations advisor to discuss resources and support for your on-campus program or event. Examples of programs and activities involving minors include hosting campus tours and workshops for K-12 students.

      "text": "HOME Org Toolkit Event Planning: TAP Travel Tips for Student Org Members Travel Tips for Student Org Members Registered student organizations travel for many purposes: community service, retreats, conferences, competitions, and for fun! Review the tips and information below, gathered from outside sources. Please check other sources that may inform your safety plan, as safety is your personal responsibility. Registered student organizations are independent entities, and are not official units of UC San Diego. Therefore, UC San Diego is not responsible for the acts or omissions of registered student organizations and/or any members/ persons acting on behalf of those student organizations. It's important to remember that travel is considered a high-risk activity. But with proper risk management, your registered student organization can reduce the risks associated with travel. Travel planning resources Be cautious and proactive. Principal members should create a travel roster, emergency contact sheet, and travel plan before traveling, and take a copy of these documents along on the trip. AAA Guide to Trouble-Free Travel (PDF) International travel The University generally recommends against all international travel by student organizations due to the myriad of risks travelers face in foreign countries. Student organizations are discouraged from traveling to foreign countries due to the wide variety of risks involved with foreign travel, and the extensive planning efforts required by the student organization’s members to manage those risks. Security risks and health care services vary widely from one country to another, so thorough research on those topics is especially important. International travelers are advised to research U.S. State Department Travel Advisories and abide by all recommended alerts and warnings, and procure travel insurance with medical coverage that covers their chosen destination because most USA health plans are not valid in foreign countries. Travelers' Checklist: U.S. Department of State Travel Warnings & Alerts: U.S. Department of State Travelers' Health: Center for Disease Control & Prevention Air travel Comply with the TSA's federal laws regulating air travel and the rules of the specific airline you use. Car travel: For drivers Review the California Department of Motor Vehicles DMV Handbook for a summary of the laws and regulations outlined in the California Vehicle Code (CVC). Review The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA website for safety guidelines on risky driving and road safety. Car travel: For passengers Be aware that you are taking a risk riding in any vehicle, and that you are doing so at your own risk and responsibility. Be safe passengers and do not distract the driver in any way. Wear your seatbelt at all times. It is important to wear your seat belt on every trip, no matter how short. Car travel: Items to take along Cell phone with charger Pencil and notebook Vehicle operating manual Emergency service information Flashlight with extra batteries Flares, warning triangles, or reflectors Coolant and fire extinguisher Ice scraper, snow brush, and snow shovel, if climate demands First-aid kit See the complete list of AAA-recommended items (PDF). Car travel: Driving in bad weather Check the weather before you leave and allow additional time to reach your destination, or postpone your trip until weather improves. Review AAA's wet weather driving tips and winter driving tips. Be sure you and your passenger(s) wear your seatbelt at all times. Car travel: Vehicle breakdowns What to do when your vehicle breaks down: Note your vehicle's location Assess your vehicle's operating problem Pull off the road Alert other motorists Communicate your situation See the complete AAA brochure: What To Do When Your Vehicle Breaks Down (PDF). Car travel: In case of an auto accident Make sure you know what to do when an accident happens, so you can be prepared if and when it occurs.

You are required to review this document on Naming Your Student Organizations which outlines policies and guidelines pertaining to: Use of the University’s name in your student organization Use of duplicate student organization names The University’s branding guidelines for student organizations Each student organization is required to describe clearly and specifically the purpose of the organization. If the stated purpose is too vague or general, you will be contacted to provide more information. Step 3.

Some student organization categories have additional registration requirements that could include: Specific affiliations, acquiring a Community Mentor, turning in rosters, waivers, and insurance forms, and other documents or special requirements Student Organization Type Your Principal Members determine your type of group. Your group is considered: An undergraduate organization and eligible for Associated Students funding if 100% of the principal members are undergraduates.

Helpful Tips for Managing your Student Organizations’ Finances: Use a central mailing addressStudent organizations should use their UC San Diego mailing address to receive bank statements and notifications. This way, statements and other notifications that might identify financial mismanagement cannot be easily hidden from the student organization's membership.Student Organization Name9500 Gilman Drive, #0078La Jolla, CA 92092-0078Checks and paper statements are becoming increasingly rare. If statements are being emailed or require online access, multiple recipients or users should be authorized. Apply for Tax Identification NumberEvery bank account is required to have a tax identification number associated with it. Student organizations are not eligible to use the University of California, San Diego tax ID number for the purpose of setting up a student organization bank account. Therefore, it is recommended that the organization apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS for use in the bank's tax reporting requirements. Remove your information from accounts when you leaveWhen you are no longer associated with the student organization, due to graduation or any other reason, be sure to communicate with the bank and have your personal information removed from any accounts. If you don't remove yourself from the accounts, you can be held responsible for financial obligations. Also, transferring your account status to a current organization member ensures a smooth transition for the organization.

Follow these guidelines when you're presenting a high profile program: Meet with your student organizations advisor at least three weeks in advance to discuss the following: Type and length of presentation Q&A format and length Role of sponsor in conducting program Security needed in the event of disruption Applicable university policies At the beginning of your event, it is highly encouraged that the presenter announce the responsibilities and expectations of the sponsor, guests, and university officials. Provide instructions on how attendants can engage with the presentation or leave if they decide to do so. Publicity should also include relevant information about admission parameters (e.g. bag checks and prohibited items). A demarcated area may be needed to ensure audience and speaker safety. Report promptly to university officials any behavior that disrupts or obstructs the presentation, or if an audience member enters the speaker area without the speaker's or moderator's permission.

      "section": "How to Make the Most of Your Volunteer Experience",
      "text": "HOME Community Service Volunteer Resources Making the Most of Your Volunteer Experience How to Make the Most of Your Volunteer Experience Learn how to make your volunteer experience last a lifetime. Pick the right project Ask yourself: What kinds of work would I like to do? What groups would I like to help (such as children, seniors, animals)? What social or environmental issues would I like to address? How much time do I have to volunteer? What do I want to get out of volunteering? A chance to meet people, make a difference, use a skill or talent, or gain professional experience and contacts? Choose organizations. Find organizations you're interested in, then: Ask for a tour of the facility Ask questions that interest you Stretch beyond your comfort level. Something you've never tried before could put you in contact with new groups and help you build new skills. Relate, engage, go above & beyond Relate effectively to the people you serve. If you're working with the organization's clients, listen to them more than you talk. Listening validates others' experiences and helps them feel comfortable. Who knows? Maybe you'll learn some things as you listen. Avoid extremely personal questions or questions that might embarrass clients. Engage. Go out of your way to interact with the people you're serving, other volunteers, and staff people. Even if you're working on just a short project, sharing yourself can have a lasting impact on others. Watch for lasting impacts others have on you, too. Go above and beyond. If you finish the task you came to do, ask the agency for another project that could use your help. You'll get to see a different aspect of the organization and gain another experience. Reflect: Evaluate experiences with reflection activities About reflection Reflection helps increase sensitivity to community issues, expanding our capacity to serve more effectively. Reflection also lets you monitor service experiences through discussion and interaction, helping you feel both challenged and supported as you: Think critically about your volunteer or service experience Understand the complexity of the experience and put it in a larger context Challenge, but not necessarily change, attitudes, beliefs, assumptions, privileges, prejudices, and stereotypes Transform a single project into further involvement or broader issue awareness Ask \"Why?\" The Social Change Model of Leadership can be useful in reflection activities. The model sees all students as potential leaders and views service as an effective way to develop leadership skills. It focuses on 3 main areas affected by the service experience: The individual The group Community/ society Reflective questions and activities center around 7 critical values: Consciousness of self is awareness of values, emotions, attitudes, and beliefs that motivate one to take action and better understand others. Congruency means thinking, feeling, and behaving with consistency, genuineness, authenticity, and honesty toward others. Commitment implies intensity and duration. It requires significant involvement and investment of one's self in the activity and its intended outcomes. It is the energy that drives the collective effort. Collaboration is the primary means of empowering others and self through trust. Collaboration can occur when one has trust in the diversity of multiple talents and perspectives of the group. Common purpose lets you work with shared aims and values. It implies the ability to engage in collective analysis of the issues at hand and the tasks to be undertaken. Controversy with civility recognizes two realities of any group effort: Differences in viewpoint are inevitable and valuable. Such differences must be aired openly but with civility. Citizenship describes the process that connects you responsibly to the environment and the community. It acknowledges the interdependence of all involved in the leadership or service effort. Evaluation of each community service experience helps you determine if the project's goals and learning objectives were met and strengthens your ability to design and implement service projects. Evaluate projects from several perspectives: How successful was the project for the agency? How successful was the project for the people who use the agency's services? How successful was the project for each participant? How successful was the project for your group as a whole? What changes could be made to improve the project's overall success? Develop a brief set of questions and ask participants to respond in writing and then in small groups (time permitting). Sample questions: To what extent did the experience meet your expectations? What might have helped make your experience better? What community needs did your service fulfill? What community needs were not addressed? What would you do differently next time? How could you be prepared better for future involvement in the community? Adapted from PARE, University of Maryland, Office of Community Service Learning. Reflection activities These questions and activities incorporate the 7 critical values of social change model of leadership. Discussion After students complete their volunteer service, ask open-ended questions to stimulate discussion: What does the agency do well? What would you like to see done differently? What did you learn about the issue the agency addresses or the population it serves? Have you learned a skill or clarified an interest? How can you apply it? What have you learned about yourself? In what ways were your stereotypes or assumptions challenged? How has this service experience supported your values? Would you want to serve with this organization again? How responsive is this organization to community needs? What about your experience can you share with your peers or fellow volunteers/ activists? What, So what, Now what? Have everyone answer three questions in writing, in writing then sharing, and in open discussion. What did we do, see, hear, smell, touch, taste? So what does it all mean? Now what? Where do I/ we go from here? Free-write Give volunteers a few minutes to write their feelings about the project. Ask for volunteers to share in small groups what they have written. Artistic expression Pass out crayons and paper. Have participants draw their feelings about the project or what they experienced. Emphasize that artistic skill is irrelevant. Invite participants to share their drawings. Graffiti boards Use newsprint around the room as graffiti boards and ask participants to respond to thoughtful questions, quotes, or statistics. Sentence stems Read some sentence stems aloud and have participants write and/ or share their thoughts. Examples: Today I learned ... What surprised me about today was ... The most challenging thing about today was ... The best thing about today was ... Travel time Make use of travel time by implementing reflective activities on the bus or in a car. Notecards Ask students to write questions that arose from their service experience on notecards. Place the notecards in the center of the circle in a pile. Ask each student to draw a card and respond to the question. String game Have participants stand in a circle. Give one person a ball of string. Ask the person with the string to talk about his or her experience, then throw the ball of string to another group member while holding onto the end of the string. Leaders and participants ask the person now holding the ball of string a question about his or her experience. Have participants continue to toss the ball and share their responses. When everyone has had a turn, process the exercise by pointing out the pattern that has emerged in the string. Emphasize the connections that were made and the role each person had in the finished design. You can use this as a metaphor for community and to illustrate the importance each person's actions has on others. Record your experiences Update your resume with your new skills. Your Co-Curricular Record (CCR) will be updated upon completion of the program. You can use your CCR to help demonstrate to employers, graduate/professional programs, and for awards the competencies and skills you gained through your experience.

      "text": "HOME Sorority & Fraternity Join SFL! Multicultural Greek Council The Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) at UC San Diego was founded in 2002 by five culturally based organizations with the purpose of standing united as one strong voice dedicated to representing our diverse interests and values. Currently, the council is composed of cultural and identity-based organizations. Our organizations were founded to bring underrepresented and underserved populations together as a community to celebrate our cultures, identities, and lived experiences. Our organizations also participate in philanthropic efforts and community service projects to help give back to the greater San Diego community. Find more information on MGC's Instagram: @mgcatucsandiego From the MGC President: Serving as council president within Sorority and Fraternity Life (SFL) has been one of the most transformative experiences of my life. As a first-generation Latino student, stepping into this leadership role has not only strengthened my ability to lead and inspire others, but it has also significantly sharpened my networking skills — an essential tool as I work toward my dream of becoming a surgeon. Every connection, every conversation, and every challenge has taught me how to build bridges, advocate for others, and push myself beyond my comfort zone. What I love most about being council president is the incredible sense of community that MGC provides; it truly feels like a home away from home, a family that uplifts and empowers one another. Through this journey, I have discovered new layers of resilience, confidence, and passion within myself — lessons that I know will serve me far beyond college. Being part of such a vibrant, supportive community reminds me daily that my dreams are not just possible, but within reach, and that representation, perseverance, and unity can spark incredible change. - Elijah Gonzales, Multicultural Greek Council President (Elijah Gonzales, MGC President) MGC Sororities Alpha Gamma Alpha Chi Delta Theta Kappa Zeta Phi Lambda Theta Alpha Lambda Theta Nu Mu Delta Alpha Phi Lambda Rho Sigma Omicron Pi Sigma Pi Alpha Upsilon Kappa Delta MGC Fraternities Alpha Epsilon Omega Lambda Theta Phi Nu Alpha Kappa Psi Chi Omega Join SFL!

National Pan-Hellenic Council The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) is the governing council and collaborative body of the 9 Historically African American sororities and fraternities. The primary purpose of NPHC is camaraderie, academic excellence, and service to the community. NPHC organizations host a variety of social, service and cultural programs throughout the year aimed at educating members of the community. The NPHC includes nine organizations, often referred to as “The Divine Nine.” Find more information on NPHC's Instagram @nphc_at_ucsd From the NPHC President: As a returning council president of the National Pan-Hellenic Council, my involvement in SFL has deeply shaped my leadership, personal growth, and sense of community. Serving in this role has pushed me to think creatively while staying grounded in my purpose—supporting and uplifting my community. Though our council is small, it is mighty, and what inspired me to serve two terms was my deep love for this community and the vision to build a lasting foundation for those who come after me. Since NPHC only recently gained official recognition, stepping into this position, especially as a liaison for city-wide members, has taught me the importance of resilience, strategic thinking, and intentional leadership. I've learned to make decisions not just for the present but with a future-focused mindset, hoping to leave behind a stronger, more connected council. What I love most about being council president is the opportunity to make a tangible impact, give back to a community that has given so much to me, and continue feeding the \"why\" that drives my commitment. - Jaliyah Journigan, National Pan-Hellenic Council President (Jaliyah Journigan, NPHC President) NPHC Organizations Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

Factors like facility type, audience size, cash handling, and alcohol serving, for example, must be considered. Student Life collaborates with UC San Diego Police and approved security companies to review events for security needs. To determine the number of guards required, please connect with a facility manager of your venue, as they typically determine security requirements. You can also reach out to the event production staff, or your student organization advisor for questions about your event logistics. For more information, see Security and Safety at Student Events. Insurance and liability waivers Event Insurance: The University of California has purchased insurance to cover Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) for most on-campus events. The university pays for the coverage, but RSOs must ensure their event is registered with the carrier. The event insurance module on TAP will guide you on whether registration is necessary. Event Waivers: Please review the UC Hazard Class Chart (PDF) to determine whether your event requires participant waivers. Event waivers are also required if participants are minors or non-affiliates. If required, student organizations may create and store electronic waivers online through the ewaivers.ucsd.edu website. Certificate of Liability: A current Certificate of Liability Insurance is required of all off-campus catering vendors, in addition to other vendors as specified by the University. For more information about insurance, waivers, and certificate of liability, visit Required Insurance and Liability Waivers. Showing films and videos In order for student organizations to show films and shows outside of an academic classroom setting, Public Performance Rights (PPR) are needed. You can learn more about this policy and how to obtain rights here. Public Performance Rights (PPR) are required whenever a film or show is shown outside of an academic setting in places accessible to the public or large gatherings beyond a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances (Title 17, U.S. Code). PPRs can be obtained by contacting the copyright holder and purchasing them, or obtaining written permission to screen the film. PPRs often come with costs, which can exceed $500. It is crucial that you plan ahead since it may take at least 2 weeks to acquire the rights for your selected film/show. Contact your student organization advisor for more information. Event sponsors Consider having two or more organizations or departments sponsor your program and share the cost and responsibilities. Recommended statement for events with event sponsors: The following statement is recommended to be verbally stated at an event and included on any advertisement (i.e. flyers, websites, or public communication) when an event is sponsored by on- or off-campus entities: \"The views expressed at these events do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors or of the University of California, San Diego. As a public institution of higher education, UCSD supports and protects the free expression of a variety of ideas and perspectives, which is vital to a learning community.\" Parking To obtain an estimate of costs for guest parking and transportation services, visit: Arrange Event Parking and Transportation for Guests. For an official quote, please email eventsparking@ucsd.edu or submit a Space Request Form. Since student organizations do not have a departmental index, please specify \"Check\" in the Space Request form when prompted for the index number. This is unless your organization received department/university funding to cover parking costs. Payments made via check must be delivered in person to the Transportation Services office at Campus Service Complex Building D. This should be done within 5 business days of receiving the reservation confirmation or at least 2 days before the event date, whichever comes first. For further inquiries, please reach out to Transportation Services directly at eventsparking@ucsd.edu. Triton Print & Digital Media Triton Print & Digital Media is an on-campus print and document service that can be used for: Flyers Programs Posters and Banners See Printing and Duplication Services. Fundraising events/ raffles for outside charities To fundraise for an outside charity, you must obtain an official letter from your chosen charity that includes their taxpayer ID number and specifics on how the funds raised align with your organization’s purpose. This letter must be displayed during your fundraising event. You must turn in a fundraising Income Report (PDF) to your advisor or to Student Life Business Operations within 14 days of your fundraising event. Student Organizations wishing to hold a raffle or opportunity drawing should carefully review State and University policies here. If you have questions, please contact Student Legal Services for free legal counsel. For more information, visit Fundraising Events for Outside Charities Ticket sales Check with facility/ venue contact to determine the venue capacity before starting your ticket sales. Depending on the event type, venue, and capacity, you may need to hire ticket takers. For more details, your CSI advisor can provide further assistance. Remember that A.S., GPSA and Triton Community Fund (TCF) will not fund events that charge admission fees. Please read the AS Funding Guide, GPSA Funding Guide or the TCF Funding Guide for more information. Vendors In order for vendor items to be paid for, you MUST provide: An invoice or official quote from the vendor. This MUST be uploaded to the vendor module in TAP more than 14 days prior to the event date. If using university funding, purchases must be made from an approved vendor. See Approved Vendors List. For any off-campus vendors that are not listed in the approved other vendors list (remove link for clarity), a Certificate of Liability Insurance (sample PDF) must be uploaded to TAP. If you're trying to use a vendor not listed in the approved other vendors list (remove link for clarity), please work with your student organization advisor more than 21 days prior to your event.

      "text": "HOME Org Toolkit Event Planning: TAP Travel Tips for Student Org Members Travel Tips for Student Org Members Registered student organizations travel for many purposes: community service, retreats, conferences, competitions, and for fun! Review the tips and information below, gathered from outside sources. Please check other sources that may inform your safety plan, as safety is your personal responsibility. Registered student organizations are independent entities, and are not official units of UC San Diego. Therefore, UC San Diego is not responsible for the acts or omissions of registered student organizations and/or any members/ persons acting on behalf of those student organizations. It's important to remember that travel is considered a high-risk activity. But with proper risk management, your registered student organization can reduce the risks associated with travel. Travel planning resources Be cautious and proactive. Principal members should create a travel roster, emergency contact sheet, and travel plan before traveling, and take a copy of these documents along on the trip. AAA Guide to Trouble-Free Travel (PDF) International travel The University generally recommends against all international travel by student organizations due to the myriad of risks travelers face in foreign countries. Student organizations are discouraged from traveling to foreign countries due to the wide variety of risks involved with foreign travel, and the extensive planning efforts required by the student organization’s members to manage those risks. Security risks and health care services vary widely from one country to another, so thorough research on those topics is especially important. International travelers are advised to research U.S. State Department Travel Advisories and abide by all recommended alerts and warnings, and procure travel insurance with medical coverage that covers their chosen destination because most USA health plans are not valid in foreign countries. Travelers' Checklist: U.S. Department of State Travel Warnings & Alerts: U.S. Department of State Travelers' Health: Center for Disease Control & Prevention Air travel Comply with the TSA's federal laws regulating air travel and the rules of the specific airline you use. Car travel: For drivers Review the California Department of Motor Vehicles DMV Handbook for a summary of the laws and regulations outlined in the California Vehicle Code (CVC). Review The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA website for safety guidelines on risky driving and road safety. Car travel: For passengers Be aware that you are taking a risk riding in any vehicle, and that you are doing so at your own risk and responsibility. Be safe passengers and do not distract the driver in any way. Wear your seatbelt at all times. It is important to wear your seat belt on every trip, no matter how short. Car travel: Items to take along Cell phone with charger Pencil and notebook Vehicle operating manual Emergency service information Flashlight with extra batteries Flares, warning triangles, or reflectors Coolant and fire extinguisher Ice scraper, snow brush, and snow shovel, if climate demands First-aid kit See the complete list of AAA-recommended items (PDF). Car travel: Driving in bad weather Check the weather before you leave and allow additional time to reach your destination, or postpone your trip until weather improves. Review AAA's wet weather driving tips and winter driving tips. Be sure you and your passenger(s) wear your seatbelt at all times. Car travel: Vehicle breakdowns What to do when your vehicle breaks down: Note your vehicle's location Assess your vehicle's operating problem Pull off the road Alert other motorists Communicate your situation See the complete AAA brochure: What To Do When Your Vehicle Breaks Down (PDF). Car travel: In case of an auto accident Make sure you know what to do when an accident happens, so you can be prepared if and when it occurs.

Learn more If you're considering becoming a Community Mentor, review the following information: Community Mentor Resource Training (PDF) Community Mentor Signature Page - Please find the organization you advise in order to sign the Signature Page. If you do not find their name, they have not registered their organization for this academic year. The Clery Act and Crime Reporting (PDF) Community Mentor Expectations The roles and functions of a student organization community mentor include: Meet University expectations of mentors Attend committee meetings. Provide a link between students and the University. Interpret policy and take appropriate positions on delicate issues. Meet your group's expectations of a mentor Meet with your group to determine expectations. Attend and participate in programs. Hold individual meetings with executive members. Serve as a resource person. Provide group dynamics training. Be familiar with the group's history of highs and lows.

Choose the most productive time to comment at group meetings. Be aware of the power of positive reinforcement. Allow the group to learn from failure. Observe, advise, and be aware of group dynamics; take notes and discuss with students and colleagues. Community Mentor Responsibilities The specific roles and responsibilities of a mentor vary depending on the organization and the mentor, but most student organization advisors have the following responsibilities: Leadership development Through personal interaction and program development, you can play a significant role in developing members' leadership skills and personal growth and in identifying new leaders for the organization. Specific skills you could enhance include: Interpersonal communication Planning Organization Conflict Resolution Assisting with retreats and workshops Consultation You can serve as a consultant by: Meeting regularly with officers and chairpersons to keep current on projects and events they're planning. Serving as a resource person and, through continued open interaction, pointing out new perspectives and guiding the group toward activities and individual performance. Continuity Officers and members change frequently, and at times the only link with the past is the advisor. To enhance continuity, you can: Orient new officers and members to the history and purpose of the group and help them build upon it. Help members look toward the future by developing long-term goals and communicating them to new members. Be wary if the organization focuses on \"this is the way things have always been.\" Encourage creative brainstorming to help an organization generate new ideas. Personal assistance Your interaction with members gives you a unique opportunity to assist individuals with problems: Help students maintain a balance between academic and co-curricular aspects of student life. Make appropriate referrals by using your knowledge of campus and community resources. Interpretations of policy As a representative of the University to the organization, you are constantly in a position to interpret University policies and regulations as well as state and federal laws relevant to student organizations. One example is the Clery Act and Crime Reporting, a federal law that requires institutions of higher education to report crimes, provide notice of security policies, and give finely warnings.You should also be familiar with all organization policies, such as constitution, bylaws, and protocols. Supervision You have a responsibility to both the University and the organization to keep the best interests of both in mind. In a well run organization, the supervisory role may be minimal or nonexistent, and the advisor may need to intervene only to prevent the violation of public or institutional policy. Financial supervision Each organization should have a treasurer/finance director. Work with this individual to assure accurate record keeping and budgeting. Meeting organization Attend all regular and special meetings of the organization to keep informed and be available for consultation or to introduce ideas and suggestions. Many mentors have a time slot on meeting agendas when they can let the group know about upcoming campus events, congratulate members, offer remarks or evaluation, etc. Traits of a Community Mentor Teacher and educator Mentors use expertise, knowledge, and human relations skills to help teach students effectively. Mentors teach in an informal classroom setting where attendance is voluntary. Resource person Mentors gain a great deal of experience over time, which becomes extremely valuable to an organization. Some of the dimensions of a resource person include: Knowledge of University policies and services The ability to find pertinent information A historical perspective Coordinator and motivator This role is close to that of a resource person and teacher but is more action oriented. The mentor: Acts as a motivator and overseer for the organization Provides direction and communication that keep the group moving toward its goal Partner and friend This mentor trait is perhaps the easiest trait to fulfill. The mentor can: Provide students with an opportunity to vent their frustrations Become a friend and mentor to student volunteers Counselor This role is designed to handle the most basic counseling needs. Listen to students' issues and offer suggestions. If serious problems arise, refer students to Counseling and Psychological Services.

Student organizations can choose to open an off-campus bank account with another bank of their choosing, however, other banks may have requirements different from UCU. Please note, CSI advisors cannot provide an advisor letter and/or signature. Helpful Tips for Managing your Student Organizations’ Finances: Use a central mailing addressStudent organizations should use their UC San Diego mailing address to receive bank statements and notifications. This way, statements and other notifications that might identify financial mismanagement cannot be easily hidden from the student organization's membership.Student Organization Name9500 Gilman Drive, #0078La Jolla, CA 92092-0078Checks and paper statements are becoming increasingly rare. If statements are being emailed or require online access, multiple recipients or users should be authorized. Apply for Tax Identification NumberEvery bank account is required to have a tax identification number associated with it. Student organizations are not eligible to use the University of California, San Diego tax ID number for the purpose of setting up a student organization bank account. Therefore, it is recommended that the organization apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS for use in the bank's tax reporting requirements. Remove your information from accounts when you leaveWhen you are no longer associated with the student organization, due to graduation or any other reason, be sure to communicate with the bank and have your personal information removed from any accounts. If you don't remove yourself from the accounts, you can be held responsible for financial obligations. Also, transferring your account status to a current organization member ensures a smooth transition for the organization.

      "section": "Hazing",
      "text": "HOME Org Toolkit Manage Your Student Org Hazing Hazing Read these important policies on hazing at UC San Diego, and learn how to report hazing incidents. What Is Hazing? The following are some examples of hazing divided into three categories: subtle, harassment, and violent. It is impossible to list all possible hazing behaviors because many are context-specific. While this is not an all-inclusive list, it provides some common examples of hazing traditions. Subtle Hazing Behaviors that emphasize a power imbalance between new members / rookies and other members of the group or team are termed “subtle hazing” because these types of hazing are often taken for granted or accepted as “harmless” or meaningless. Subtle hazing typically involves activities or attitudes that breach reasonable standards of mutual respect and place new members / rookies on the receiving end of ridicule, embarrassment, and/or humiliation tactics. New members / rookies often feel the need to endure subtle hazing to feel like part of the group or team. (Some types of subtle hazing may also be considered harassment hazing). Some examples: Deception Assigning demerits Silence periods with implied threats for violation Deprivation of privileges granted to other members Tasks of personal servitude Memorization of information not explicitly required by the national new member process Requiring new members / rookies to perform duties not assigned to other members Socially isolating new members / rookies Line-ups and drills / tests on meaningless information Name calling Requiring new members / rookies to refer to other members with titles (e.g. “Mr.,” “Miss”) while they are identified with demeaning terms Expecting certain items to always be in one's possession Harassment Hazing Behaviors that cause emotional anguish or physical discomfort in order to feel like part of the group. Harassment hazing confuses, frustrates, and causes undue stress for new members / rookies. (Some types of harassment hazing can also be considered violent hazing.) Some examples: Verbal abuse Threats or implied threats Asking new members to wear embarrassing or humiliating attire Wearing publicly, apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste, or requiring shaved hair Stunt or skit nights with degrading, crude, or humiliating acts Participating in personally degrading or humiliating games or activities Expecting new members / rookies to perform personal service to other members such as errands, cooking, cleaning etc Creation of extensive fatigue or forced or coerced participation in calisthenics, push-ups, sit-ups, running, and other fatiguing activities Tuck-ins Required (explicit or implicit) participation in quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips, or any such activities Engaging in public stunts or buffoonery Requiring the carrying of objects, such as bricks, buckets, or large objects Sleep deprivation Late work sessions or activities that interfere with scholastic activities, including exhausting and time consuming projects that are too disruptive to normal study patterns Sexual simulations Intentionally creating clean-up work Expecting new members / rookies to be deprived of maintaining a normal schedule of bodily cleanliness Be expected to harass others Any activity considered morally offensive by an individual participating Any activity without constructive aspect or reasonable purpose, including but not limited to \"line-ups,\" \"rat courts,\" mock trials, interrogations, yelling of obscenities, or votes of continuance not consistent with the national constitution of, or sanctioned by the national fraternity or sorority Violent Hazing Behaviors that have the potential to cause physical and/or emotional, or psychological harm. Some examples: Forced or coerced alcohol or other drug consumption Forced, required, or coerced consumption of any food, liquid or other substance Physical abuse including paddling, beating, tattooing, pushing, hitting, physical threats, exposure to the elements, or other physical harm, or forms of assault Branding Forced or coerced ingestion of vile substances or concoctions Burning Water intoxication Expecting abuse or mistreatment of animals Public nudity Expecting illegal activity Bondage Confining participants to rooms or areas that are uncomfortable due to temperature, noise, size, or air quality for the purpose of harassment Any dangerous activity including, but not limited to long swims, jumps from high places, binding, and blindfolding Member ditches, abductions / kidnaps Exposure to cold weather or extreme heat without appropriate protection Any other activity which is not consistent with the fraternal law, ritual, or policy and/ or University Policies Laws and Campus Policies on Hazing California Law Matt's Law, (Senate Bill 1454) sponsored by Tom Torlakson (D-Antioch, CA), is a California law that allows for felony prosecutions when serious injuries or deaths result from hazing rites. The bill increases the severity of charges for some hazing rituals, from misdemeanors to felonies, and for the first time gives prosecutors the ability to seek hazing charges against non students. In a 34-2 vote, Matt’s Law passed the state Senate on May 30th, 2006. On September 19, 2006, the statute was signed into law by governor Arnold Schwarznegger. Matt's Law was named in memory of Matt Carrington, a 21-year-old California State University, Chico student from Concord, California. Carrington died in the basement of a fraternity house located two short blocks from campus. Prior to the enactment of Matt's Law, hazing — even in the case of death — was only a misdemeanor, as part of California's education code, rather than punishable under the state's penal code. Matt's law prevents unaffiliated fraternities from using the argument that they cannot be punished for hazing, simply because they are not student organizations. The law also gives prosecutors clear authority to bring charges against anyone or any organization involved in hazing, not just currently enrolled students. BILL TEXTPASSED THE SENATE - AUGUST 30, 2006PASSED THE ASSEMBLY - AUGUST 24, 2006INTRODUCED BY Senator TorlaksonFebruary 23, 2006THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:SEC. 3. Section 245.6 is added to the Penal Code, to read: (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as \"Matt's Law\" in memory of Matthew William Carrington, who died on February 2, 2005 as a result of hazing. (b) As used in this section \"hazing\" or \"haze\" is conduct which causes, or is likely to cause, bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to another person in the course of the other person's preinitiation into, initiation into, affiliation with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in any organization. The terms \"hazing\" or \"haze\" do not include customary athletic, fire department, police department, military, or quasi-military training, conditioning, or similar events or activities.(c) Any person who hazes or conspires to participate in hazing is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by both fine and imprisonment.(d) Any person who hazes or conspires to participate in hazing which results in death, great bodily injury, or great psychological injury is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.(e) An organization is guilty of violating subdivisions (b) or (c) if the organization's agents, directors, trustees, managers, or officers authorized, requested, commanded, encouraged, participated in, ratified, or tolerated the hazing.(f) The implied or expressed consent of the person or persons against whom the hazing was directed shall not be a defense to any action brought under this section.(g) This section does not apply to the person against whom the hazing was directed.(h) This section shall not, in any manner, limit or exclude prosecution or punishment for any other crime or any civil remedy.(i) The person against whom the hazing is directed may commence a civil action for injury or damages, including mental and physical pain and suffering that results from the hazing. The action may be brought against any participants in the hazing, or any organization whose agents, directors, trustees, managers, or officers authorized, requested, commanded, encouraged, participated in, ratified, or tolerated the hazing. If the organization is a corporation, whether for profit or not, the individual directors of the corporation maybe held individually liable for damages. SEC. 4. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.rev. 4/2007 SA-KW University Policies Student Conduct Code Student Organization Case Status Summaries In addition to managing the student conduct process for individuals, the Office of Student Conduct works with several campus partners, including the Center for Student Involvement, on cases regarding non-academic misconduct by Student Organizations. It is the belief of the Office of Student Conduct and these partners that students should be able to make informed choices when pursuing ways to get involved on campus. Therefore we have provided information below on Student Organizations' most recent conduct case summaries to assist students in making these decisions. Here you will find some brief information on the disciplinary status of some of our student organizations: Student Organization Case Status Summaries Sanctions for Hazing Hazing is a violation of both the UCSD Conduct Code and California law, whether the alleged activities occurred on campus or off campus. Student organizations and/or individual students accepting responsibility or found responsible for hazing may be suspended or dismissed from the University in addition to facing potential criminal sanctions, such as prison incarceration and monetary fines. Student organizations, sports clubs, and athletic teams involved in alleged hazing activities may lose their status as campus organizations. The UC San Diego policy on hazing can be found in the Student Conduct Code. The policy reads as follows: Section VII (K). Participation in hazing or any method of initiation or pre-initiation of potential, new, or active members into a Student Organization or other activity engaged in by the Student Organization or members of the Student Organization at any time that causes, or is likely to cause, physical injury or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in psychological harm to any Student or other person. Responding to Charges of Hazing Organizations charged with hazing may argue that an activity wasn't hazing because new members agreed to participate (perhaps due to peer pressure and a desire to fit in). But even if new members agreed to participate, the activity can still be considered hazing. Another common defense is that rogue members committed the hazing activity, unsanctioned by the organization. However, organizations have lost their campus status for hazing activities performed by members outside the leadership circle. Organization leaders are ultimately responsible for communicating ground rules for new member activities and for monitoring Learn More About Hazing Who commits hazing on California campuses? Hazing is commonly portrayed in movies as an activity of Greek fraternities and sororities. Hazing also occurs in intercollegiate athletics, sports clubs, religious clubs, marching bands, professional clubs, multicultural organizations, and other types of groups. Why does hazing persist on college campuses? Organizations are sometimes unaware that their initiation activities are actually hazing. Initiates may be hesitant to question such activities, which are often handed down by older members. The group may offset concerns about possible harm with the belief that they are fostering loyalty and bonding. No matter what group members believe, no one should ever be subjected to hazing. How can an organization determine if its activities count as hazing? To determine if activities are possibly harmful, organizations should consider how acceptable they would be from the perspective of the broader community. The \"publicity test\" asks the following questions: Would you let the campus newspaper or a local TV station cover your initiation activities? Would you be comfortable describing your activities to your parents, a professor, psychologist, or university chancellor? If the answer to these questions is \"No,\" your activities are most likely hazing. When in doubt, check with your organization's advisor or coach. Tips for new members If you are a new member of an organization, stay connected with friends outside of the group. If you suspect an activity may be hazing, talk to friends and family members about what you are experiencing and seek their advice. Refuse to participate in an activity if you suspect it's hazing, or quit the organization. Report any suspected hazing to campus officials, confidentially if you prefer. How to report suspected hazing incidents Any member of the campus, whether affiliated with the offending organization or not, has a responsibility to report hazing. The university takes allegations of hazing seriously and will investigate. UCSD extends its jurisdiction beyond the campus to any location where hazing has occurred. To report an incident, notify the UC San Diego Police Department or your college dean or resident dean. Additionally, below are further on-campus contacts for specific groups. Student organizations: Contact the Center for Student Involvement at hazing@ucsd.edu or call (858) 534-0501. Sports or recreation clubs: Call the sports/ recreation club advisor, (858) 534-8085. Intercollegiate athletics: Contact the coach of the sport, or call (858) 534-4211. When reporting an incident: Indicate who was involved, what happened, and when and where it occurred. Supply as much detail as possible. Provide your name, phone number, and e-mail address. Provide the contact information of any witnesses. You may file an anonymous report, but you should know that such a report can make an investigation more difficult and sometimes unsuccessful.

      "text": "HOME Org Toolkit Manage Your Student Org High Pressure Groups High Pressure Groups Some UC San Diego student organizations and events are affiliated with outside groups. While the vast majority of groups may be helpful and beneficial to you, some may use high-pressure tactics to recruit students. The information below can help you make an informed, free choice about associating with such groups. Why are high-pressure groups so harmful? They tend to isolate you from family, friends, and other groups. They may ask you to give up control of your thoughts or decisions. They may focus on guilt and shame. They may promote crises with school, your career, or your social life. What are warning signs of a high-pressure group? Ask yourself these questions: Does the group or its representatives: Speak in a derogatory way about your past religious affiliation? Describe your parents as unable to understand or help you with religious matters? Label your doubts and questions as signs of a weak faith? Invite you on a retreat but can't (or won't) give you an overview of the purpose or activities before you go? Insist that you spend so much time with them that you can't get your studying done or you don't have time for your other friends and activities? Pressure you to get others involved in the group? Discourage you from keeping in touch with your family and friends or not allow you to talk to your friends or your family alone? Deflect questions you ask about their group and tell you they'll answer your questions later? Claim to have the answers to your problems and that you can't find answers anywhere else? Pressure you to give them money? Answering \"yes\" to one or two questions doesn't mean that a group is destructive or harmful, but it does mean you should proceed slowly and investigate the group more carefully. Questions?
